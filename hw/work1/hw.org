* Exercise 2: Input


1.
   Modify the script hello.py so that when run the user will be able
   to type its name just after an appropriate message and a welcome
   message will appear in return. 

   #+begin_src python
     name = str(input("What's your name? "))

     print("Hello", name, ", welcome to the programming school.")
   #+end_src

2. Create and edit a new script named circle.py which asks for a
   diameter and prints the area of a corresponding circle.

   #+begin_src python
     diameter = float(input("Diameter: "))
     PI = 3.1415


     area = PI * diameter * diameter / 4
     print("Area: ", area)
   #+end_src


* Exercise 4: For

1. Create a script named piapprox.py that let approximate π by
   Gregory-Leibnitz serie :
   #+begin_src python
     N = 1000
     pi = 0

     for i in range(N):
         pi += 4*(-1)**i/(2*i+1)

     print(pi)
   #+end_src

2. Create a script named pibyrandom.py that computes an approximation
   of π by Monte- Carlo’s method, i.e. by choosing random points in
   the unit square, and counting the proportion of them that lies in the
   unit circle (distance from origin ⩽ 1). The user should be able to
   choose how many random points will be generated :
   #+begin_src python
     import random as rd

     pi = 0
     N = 10000
     inside = 0

     for i in range(N):
         x = rd.random()
         y = rd.random()
         d = x*x + y*y

         # count points inside circle
         if(d<=1): inside+=1

     # area circle = 2*2 = 4
     # area square = pi 

     area_circle = inside
     area_square = N
     pi = 4*area_circle/area_square

     print(pi)
   #+end_src
